A currently text-based (no GUI) sudoku game. I decided to build a sudoku generator and solver as I took a long break (4 months, it was a busy summer) from programming and need to sharpen up my skills.

A solving method that utilises Donald Knuth's Dancing Links Algorithm is currently being implemented to allow the process of solving to be far more efficient.
